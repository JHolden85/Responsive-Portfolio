## My Portfolio

This repo contains links to the various projects from my time working in the UCI coding bootcamp from 2020 to 2021. As each major project was completed, I added the sources to my main page fro easy navigation, and a succinct collection of my work.

With each assignment, I have further stretched my knowledge of full stack development and pushed myself to constantly gain more experience to impliment in the job market.
